OwO What's this?
*unzips your file*

Alright if you're reading this then you're smart enough to change images manually
All art data is stored in 'User Art/', images are stored in 'User Art/Art', tag data is stored in 'User Art/CSV'
You can manually add or delete art this way 
**HOWEVER**
If you delete an image YOU NEED TO MANUALY DELETE ITS CSV FILE OR IT'LL STICK AROUND FOREVER
If you add an image the program will automatically give it a CSV file and fill out its meta-data

You can also manually change tags this way(but you're much more prone to bugs)
Opening the .CSV(comma-separated values) files will let you manually change tags instead of using the program
1st line: artist tags
2nd line: link tags
3rd line: tag tags
4th line: meta tags(please don't mess with this one it'll probably mess something up)

If you're adding a link tag make sure to put [*website*] in front of the url so the program knows which icon to use.

Speaking of which, the icons are stored under 'BERT/resource/LNK' if you want to change them
You can also **THEORETICALLY** add new website icons and new website link tags manually, but let me make this clear
**Doing this will probably break something really badly.**

Anyways for making it this far have some dog photos
